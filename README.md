This is a project by team Syntax Errors, the 3rd place team in a 36 hour hackathon Vinhack 2023 hosted by VinnovateIT in VIT vellore.
it is a simple app made for VITians to sort their recieved mail into various label groups provided by gmail.
the project is written in google apps script and ran through there.
There is no official deployment as of yet but it works as intended automatically but requires some setup before hand.

Steps to get your own labeler up and running:
1. run the 'deleteAll' function
2. run the 'makeLabels' function
3. run 'main' function

It uses a repeater created in main() to repeatedly check the last 50 items every 5 mins and sorts them to their respective label groups.
